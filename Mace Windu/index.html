<p> <font size = "4">Ahsoka Tano, nicknamed "Snips" by her Master and known as "Ashla" after the Clone Wars, was a Jedi Padawan who, after the conflict, helped establish a network of various rebel cells against the Galactic Empire. A Togruta female, Tano was discovered on her homeworld of Shili by Jedi Master Plo Koon, who brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to receive Jedi training. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda assigned the young Tano to be the Padawan learner of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whom she joined at the Battle of Christophsis. Whereas Tano was eager to prove herself, Skywalker had a reputation for recklessness, and they had a rather difficult start as Master and apprentice. Yet, they worked together to rescue Rotta, the son of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and returned Rotta to his father, thus facilitating a crucial alliance between the Hutt Clan and the Galactic Republic.

As a commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, Tano found a mentor in Clone Captain Rex of the 501st Legion, with whom she and Skywalker collaborated to lead frontline campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In her first command position at the Battle of Ryloth, Tano disobeyed orders and lost her entire squadron of pilots, but she managed to rebound and helped secure a victory at Ryloth. Her assignments pitted her against a variety of opponents, from General Grievous and Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress to such bounty hunters as Cad Bane and Aurra Sing. Over time, she matured into a respected leader, contributing to key Republic victories like the Second Battle of Geonosis and the Battle of Mon Cala. She even died during a series of events on Mortis, but the Force wielder known as the Daughter sacrificed herself to bring Tano back to life.
Tano gained much experience on and beyond the war front, leading a group of Jedi younglings to revolt against their Trandoshan captors, helping rescue a colony of Togruta from enslavement by the Zygerrian Slave Empire, and serving as an advisor to the Onderon rebels—with her close friend, Lux Bonteri, among them—as they liberated their world from the Confederacy. In a stark turn of events, Tano was framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar and other homicides, and she escaped into the Coruscant underworld to clear her name. Though she formed an unlikely alliance with Asajj Ventress, she was detained by Republic forces and was consequently barred from the Jedi Order. Ultimately, Skywalker uncovered the true culprit, Tano's friend and fellow Padawan Barriss Offee, and prevented his former apprentice from being convicted of sedition. Nevertheless, the ordeal dislodged Tano's faith in the Jedi. She refused the Jedi Council's offer to rejoin the Order, instead departing in search of a new path.
After the Galactic Empire came to power, Tano went into hiding on Thabeska and Raada. Following the evacuation of Raada, Taana joined Senator Bail Organa's growing rebel movement. She became the manager of his intelligence network and adopted the codename "Fulcrum". As "Fulcrum", Tano provided intelligence to various rebel factions including Hera Syndulla's Spectres rebel cell. Tano took a particular interest in Syndulla's rebels because one of their members, a former Jedi named Kanan Jarrus, had begun to train his own Padawan, Ezra Bridger. In addition, Tano's efforts against the Empire brought her into contact with Skywalker, who by then had become the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, as well as the Imperial Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister. Following the mission to Malachor, Tano became lost to the rubble and shadows of the Sith temple and was believed by many including Jarrus and Bridger to have perished during a duel with Darth Vader Arriving in the Devaron system, Tano and Skywalker's cruiser was forced to engage Bane's Separatist fleet, as the Duros bounty hunter had already captured Ropal. Infiltrating Bane's frigate, the two Jedi stormed the bridge, using R2-D2 to access the ship's computer to locate Ropal. Unfortunately, they arrived to late, with Tano finding only his corpse inside the detention block. The Jedi then pursued Bane into the ship's gunnery room, with the latter switching off the artificial gravity as he and his battle droids attacked. After R2 reactivated the gravity, Bane attempted to flee. Tano, not willing to let him escape, pursued him despite her master's warnings. Confronting him in a dead-end corridor, Tano managed to beat Bane in hand to hand combat after he disarmed her. However, as she attempted to retrieve her lightsaber with the Force, Bane suddenly grabbed her ankle and sent a paralyzing electric shock through her body, rendering her unconscious. Bane then binded her wrists with Stuncuffs and stole her padawan Silka bead braid, holding her hostage, hoping that her master would come and try to rescue her. Once Skywalker did indeed arrive, Bane blackmailed him into unlocking his stolen holocron, threatening to launch Tano into space by opening an airlock behind her. Bane opened the airlock anyways forcing Skywalker to save his Padawan as Bane once again escaped. The Jedi escaped the exploding ship along with Rex, Denal, and several other clones troopers, completely unaware that Bane had actually killed Denal and redressed himself in the clone's armor. Tano later apologized to Skywalker for once again disobeying her master's orders, but he replied that the mission's failure was his fault and not hers.[25]

After returning from their failed mission, Tano and Skywalker were instructed by the Council to track down and intercept Bane on Naboo in order to prevent him from abducting one of the local Gungans, a Force-sensitive infant named Roo-Roo Page. Tano and Skywalker were able to ambush Bane in the infant's bedroom, with Tano confronting him with her lightsaber. After a failed escape attempt, Bane wad finally brought into custody and Page was returned to his mother. Before he was taken away, Tano reclaimed her stolen Padawan braid. Though they successfully prevented the kidnapping, there still remained several other Force-sensitive children that Bane had succeeded in stealing away, and so the two Jedi began to investigate Bane's starfighter in order to find any clues as to where he might have hidden the children. Determining that they were most likely on Mustafar, Tano and Skywalker set out immediately towards the volcanic planet. There, they managed to find the children in one of Darth Sidious's secret facilities, battling several surgery droids in order to recover the children, whom they returned safely to their respective families. After the mission, they returned to the Temple, where Tano was disappointed to learn from the Council that Bane had escaped once again.[26]</font><p>
