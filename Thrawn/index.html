<p> <font size = "4">Mitth'raw'nuruodo, more commonly known as Thrawn, was a Chiss male who served as a member of the Chiss Ascendancy and an officer in the Imperial Navy, holding the rank of Grand Admiral in the years prior to the Galactic Civil War. Thrawn hailed from the Unknown Regions and had knowledge of the uncharted region of the galaxy, knowledge that Emperor Sheev Palpatine used due to his interest in discovering the secrets of the dark side of the Force that the Unknown Regions held.

During the Clone Wars, Thrawn was exploring the Outer Rim of the galaxy to find out if the Galactic Republic could be an ally to the Chiss Ascendancy and met Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, who he aided in battle; he concluded that the Republic would be a poor ally. Years later, after the Republic had transformed into the Galactic Empire, he managed to join the Imperial Navy as a Lieutenant. Believing in the importance of understanding an enemy's culture, art, and philosophy to defeat them, Thrawn, helped by his aide Eli Vanto, rose through the ranks, defeating smugglers, insurgents, and traitors along the way.
By 2 BBY, Thrawn had been promoted to Grand Admiral and given the command of the Seventh Fleet due to his victory over a rebel insurgency at Batonn. He was then assigned to destroy the Phoenix Squadron located in the Lothal sector, which was a part of the growing rebellion against the Empire. His efforts were aimed at discovering the location of the rebel base which proved successful and allowed his forces to press an attack. The battle was a success and Phoenix Squadron was mostly destroyed; however, the Spectres, most of the important rebel leaders, escaped along with the Imperial traitor Kallus. Moreover, the Empire suffered major losses and Thrawn received a prediction of his defeat from a mysterious Force-sensitive individual known as the Bendu.
At the end of the Galactic Civil War, the remnants of the Imperial Navy, defeated by the New Republic at the Battle of Jakku, ventured into the Unknown Regions to rebuild. Thrawn's knowledge of the Unknown Regions was in part used to travel to the region of space, where the Empire's remnants reorganized into the First Order. Who were grand admirals? In the second year before the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the Death Star,[5] the rank of Grand Admiral was awarded to the Chiss Imperial officer Thrawn by Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine after Thrawn's victory at Batonn.[2]

Following the Battle of Endor, Rae Sloane served as Grand Admiral and commanded the remnants of the Imperial Navy. The Imperial rank of Grand Admiral was one of the senior ranks in the entire Imperial Military, and to be given the title was seen as a great honor.[1] New Republic Fleet Admiral Gial Ackbar was considered a Grand Admiral by the Imperial officers, although it was not an official rank utilized by the New Republic. Their uniforms were Unlike the traditional Imperial uniform, which generally consisted of a plain gray tunic, the Imperial Grand Admiral's uniform was white with golden epaulets.[2] Such accessories were generally uncommon in the Imperial Military, as they seemed to put an emphasis on status above duty and humility.[6]
Thrawn was away from his encampment when the Venator-Class Star Destroyer Strikefast led by Captain Voss Parck arrived at the planet searching for smugglers. As Parck, Colonel Mosh Barris, and Cadet Eli Vanto examined his encampment and the Sy Bisti markings on the crates around it in accordance with Imperial Unknown Alien protocols, Thrawn managed to crash a V-Wing starfighter surveying the planet with carefully placed monofilament line. Thrawn managed to remove the pilot's body from his flight suit, steal the pilot's blaster, power packs, comlink, and concussion grenades, stuff the flight suit with grass, leaves, and fermented pyussh berries, and escape the crash site before Major Wyan arrived at the scene to investigate.[3]

Once Wyan had brought the stuffed flight suit into the Imperial encampment for Parck, Barris, and Vanto to see, Thrawn set his plan to board the Strikefast into motion. Hiding on the edge of the encampment, Thrawn removed the sturm dowels from his stolen blaster power packs and strapped them to the backs of small nocturnal creatures as improvised explosives. Drawn by the smell of the fermented berries, the creatures ran into the Imperial encampment, exploding and causing chaos within the base.[3]
In response, Parck ordered another group of V-Wings to perform a grid search. Thrawn, realizing he would need to replace his stolen comm before they jammed it, managed to crash another V-Wing and swapped his stolen comm with the pilot's. Thrawn also stole the pilot's blaster, power packs, and concussion grenades, but did not remove the pilot's corpse from his flight suit. When Barris discovered that Thrawn had stolen the first pilot's comm he ordered that particular comm shut down. Barris did not, however, discover that Thrawn had swapped the first stolen comm with the second pilot's, so Thrawn was still able to eavesdrop on Imperial communications.[3]
Thrawn attacked the navy troopers with explosives throughout the night, hoping to goad the Imperials into sending stormtroopers into the forest to investigate. Once the stormtroopers were sent out in search of Thrawn, he used another explosive to dispatch one in order to study the armor, jamming the Imperials' comms in order to distract from the sound of the explosion.[3]
After the screeching of the comms subsided, Barris decided that he had had enough of Thrawn's attacks, deciding to take Thrawn's hut aboard the Strikefast to study it there. Knowing the time had come for him to return to his camp, Thrawn silently killed another stormtrooper. Filling the stormtrooper's armor with explosives, Thrawn snuck the armor into the encampment and propped it up by the transport with sticks. While the Imperials were distracted by the exploding armor, Thrawn hid himself in a power generator casing from his camp. The casing was then loaded into a transport and taken, with the rest of Thrawn's hut and crates, to the Strikefast.[3]
Once Thrawn was aboard the Strikefast, he spent two standard hours waiting in the casing before leaving his hiding place. Moving swiftly, but not so swiftly that he wouldn't be seen, Thrawn crossed the hangar and boarded a Zeta-class cargo shuttle. When Parck sent troopers to intercept him, Thrawn allowed himself to be captured without resistance.[3]
Once he had willingly surrendered himself, Thrawn was brought before Parck, Barris, and Vanto. Using Vanto as a translator, Parck asked whether Thrawn spoke basic or Sy Bisti, to which Thrawn replied that he knew a fair bit of Basic but was far more comfortable with Sy Bisti. Vanto served as Thrawn's translator for the remainder of the conversation as he told the Imperials of his exile and how he had crashed the V-Wings, attacked the camp unseen, and infiltrated the Strikefast. This conversation impressed Parck, to the point that he decided to present Thrawn to Emperor Palpatine himself.[3]
Thrawn was sent to his temporary living quarters onboard the Strikefast, and a separate meeting was held between Parck and Vanto. In this meeting it was determined that, due to his knowledge of the Chiss and Sy Bisti, Vanto would serve as Thrawn's translator and basic teacher for the duration of the trip.[3]</font><p>
