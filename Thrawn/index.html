<p> <font size = "4">Mitth'raw'nuruodo, more commonly known as Thrawn, was a Chiss male who served as a member of the Chiss Ascendancy and an officer in the Imperial Navy, holding the rank of Grand Admiral in the years prior to the Galactic Civil War. Thrawn hailed from the Unknown Regions and had knowledge of the uncharted region of the galaxy, knowledge that Emperor Sheev Palpatine used due to his interest in discovering the secrets of the dark side of the Force that the Unknown Regions held.

During the Clone Wars, Thrawn was exploring the Outer Rim of the galaxy to find out if the Galactic Republic could be an ally to the Chiss Ascendancy and met Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, who he aided in battle; he concluded that the Republic would be a poor ally. Years later, after the Republic had transformed into the Galactic Empire, he managed to join the Imperial Navy as a Lieutenant. Believing in the importance of understanding an enemy's culture, art, and philosophy to defeat them, Thrawn, helped by his aide Eli Vanto, rose through the ranks, defeating smugglers, insurgents, and traitors along the way.
By 2 BBY, Thrawn had been promoted to Grand Admiral and given the command of the Seventh Fleet due to his victory over a rebel insurgency at Batonn. He was then assigned to destroy the Phoenix Squadron located in the Lothal sector, which was a part of the growing rebellion against the Empire. His efforts were aimed at discovering the location of the rebel base which proved successful and allowed his forces to press an attack. The battle was a success and Phoenix Squadron was mostly destroyed; however, the Spectres, most of the important rebel leaders, escaped along with the Imperial traitor Kallus. Moreover, the Empire suffered major losses and Thrawn received a prediction of his defeat from a mysterious Force-sensitive individual known as the Bendu.
At the end of the Galactic Civil War, the remnants of the Imperial Navy, defeated by the New Republic at the Battle of Jakku, ventured into the Unknown Regions to rebuild. Thrawn's knowledge of the Unknown Regions was in part used to travel to the region of space, where the Empire's remnants reorganized into the First Order. Who were grand admirals? In the second year before the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the Death Star,[5] the rank of Grand Admiral was awarded to the Chiss Imperial officer Thrawn by Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine after Thrawn's victory at Batonn.[2]

Following the Battle of Endor, Rae Sloane served as Grand Admiral and commanded the remnants of the Imperial Navy. The Imperial rank of Grand Admiral was one of the senior ranks in the entire Imperial Military, and to be given the title was seen as a great honor.[1] New Republic Fleet Admiral Gial Ackbar was considered a Grand Admiral by the Imperial officers, although it was not an official rank utilized by the New Republic. Their uniforms were Unlike the traditional Imperial uniform, which generally consisted of a plain gray tunic, the Imperial Grand Admiral's uniform was white with golden epaulets.[2] Such accessories were generally uncommon in the Imperial Military, as they seemed to put an emphasis on status above duty and humility.[6]
